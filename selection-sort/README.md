### **1. Beginner: Implement Basic Selection Sort**

**Description:**  
Write a function to implement the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

**Input Example:**  
`[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

**Output Example:**  
`[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`

**Hints:**

- Divide the array into a "sorted" and "unsorted" part.
- Find the minimum element in the unsorted part and swap it with the first unsorted element.

**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

### **2. Intermediate: Sort in Descending Order**

**Description:**  
Modify the Selection Sort algorithm to sort the array in descending order instead of ascending order.

**Input Example:**  
`[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

**Output Example:**  
`[64, 25, 22, 12, 11]`

**Hints:**

- Find the maximum element in the unsorted part instead of the minimum.

**Challenge:**  
Your implementation should work for both ascending and descending order based on a parameter (e.g., `isAscending`).

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### **3. Intermediate: Find K Smallest Elements**

**Description:**  
Modify the Selection Sort algorithm to find the **K smallest elements** in an array and return them in sorted order.

**Input Example:**  
Array: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`  
`K = 3`

**Output Example:**  
`[11, 12, 22]`

**Challenge:**  
Avoid fully sorting the array. Stop once youâ€™ve found the first K smallest elements.

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### **4. Advanced: Track Number of Swaps**

**Description:**  
Write a function that sorts an array using Selection Sort and counts the total number of swaps made during the sorting process.

**Input Example:**  
`[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

**Output Example:**  
Sorted Array: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`  
Number of Swaps: `4`

**Challenge:**  
Keep the swap count efficient without adding unnecessary variables or complexity.

**Difficulty:** Advanced

---

### **5. Expert: Sort an Array of Objects**

**Description:**  
Sort an array of objects using Selection Sort based on a specific property, such as `price`.

**Input Example:**

```javascript
[
  { name: "Item A", price: 64 },
  { name: "Item B", price: 22 },
  { name: "Item C", price: 12 },
];
```

**Output Example:**

```javascript
[
  { name: "Item C", price: 12 },
  { name: "Item B", price: 22 },
  { name: "Item A", price: 64 },
];
```

**Challenge:**  
Allow dynamic sorting based on any property (e.g., `price`, `name`).

**Difficulty:** Expert

---

### **6. Expert: Handle Edge Cases**

**Description:**  
Write a robust implementation of Selection Sort that handles edge cases such as:

1. Empty array (`[]`).
2. Array with one element (`[42]`).
3. Array with duplicate elements (`[5, 3, 5, 3]`).
4. Large datasets (1 million+ elements).

**Input Example:**  
`[]`, `[42]`, `[5, 3, 5, 3]`

**Output Example:**  
For `[5, 3, 5, 3]`: `[3, 3, 5, 5]`

**Challenge:**  
Optimize your implementation to handle large datasets efficiently.

**Difficulty:** Expert
